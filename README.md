# Hybrid Approach for Ground Motion Estimation in an EEW System

- We proposed a hybrid approach for real-time ground motion estimation in an EEW system.
- We combined the state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms (here, we chose the CNN structure) and the stable PLUM algorithm.
- The CNN model (CONIP) was used for onsite seismic intensity prediction.
- The Propagation of Local Undamped Motion (PLUM) algorithm was proposed by Kodera et al. (2018).
- We trained the CONIP model and tested this bybrid approach based on KiK-net events.
